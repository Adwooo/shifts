# Feature: Shift admin manages shifts
#  In order to manage shifts
#  As a shift admin
#  I want to be able to create, assign, and destroy shifts
    
#  Scenario: Power sign up a user for a shift
#    Given I am logged in as a superuser
#    And I am on shift_admin
#    And I am on the shifts page (pending combination of shift/shift admin)
#    And I follow "Power sign up"
#    Then I should see "Power sign up"
#    Given I am on shift_admin/power_sign_up
#    When I select "Bass Library Cluster" from "Location:"
#    When I fill in "name/netid" with "bq9"
#    And I fill in "Date" with "05/08/2030"
#    And I select "08:00 AM" from "Start:"
#    And I select "09:00 AM" from "End:"
#    And I press "Power sign up"
#    Then there should be a shift with user "bq9" at location "Bass Library Cluster"
