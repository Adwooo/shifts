LocGroup
* require_role :admin, :for_all_except => [:shifts, :shifts_all]
* require_role :can_view, :only => [:shifts, shifts_all]
** checks if user can view shifts under this loc group or not, or any loc group at all
* shifts: display all shifts under a location
* shifts_all: display all shifts under all viewable location

Location
* require_role :admin, :for_all_except => [:shifts, :shifts_all]
* similar to loc group

Shift
* require_role :admin, :for => [:edit, :update, :destroy]
* new:
** reads time range, validate against time slots, validate against priority list
** if admin, allow selecting user
** if not admin, can only sign up if a time slot is open
** submit takes to action create
* not needed: show, index; because we will view shifts under a particular location or loc group

Report
* new: display shift information in order to sign in (alias route: sign_in)
** if shift_id is not given, display list of location to choose
** submit button takes user to create
* create:
** if shift_id is not given, create a shift with start, stop time as Time.now
** create first report_line
* edit:
** render reports/:report_id/report_lines/new
** submit report takes user to :update which creates the logout report_line message, update stop time
* show: display report's contents which are basically report_lines belonging to this report
* not needed: destroy; because a report is not allowed to be deleted

TimeSlot:
* should be nested under location?
* not needed: show

Access Control
* Each LocGroup has three permission levels
** view_perm
** signup_perm
** admin_perm
* Each role has many of such permissions
